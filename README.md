# SQLM - sql extensions for go

Sqlm is a set of extension for go to generate sql for inserting/updating go structs as well as
creating and dropping tables for the given structs.

It is inspired by sqlx and can be seen as an addition to [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) that focuses on parsing queries into 
structs.

This project is not ready to be used yet and is just a toy for now.

API and features are subject to change.
